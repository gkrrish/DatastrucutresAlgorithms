Algorithms :
------------
Sorting and Searching generally we call algorithms 

Sorting ---QuickSort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort etc
Searching --Linear Search,binary search


Data Structures :
----------------
Real implementations we can call DS ex: Stack, Queue etc.....















































































How the Star pattern helps VS Algorithms/Datastructures :
---------------------------------------------------------
Star patterns just makes Loop/syntax/basic programming logics improves
AlgoDS makes program analytical and design and much more makes clear. DS makes real time problems more visible.

and don't compare star patterns with DSAlgo because both are different. star patterns have less weight than DSA
